								<p>The group started its business in 1945 dealing in the wholesale & imports of photographic material later on started with the darkroom equipment like enlargers, timers, photographic chemistries, color, and black & white paper & other consumables items associated with this industry and achieved the highest level of confidence throughout the country of our valuable customers after many years of hard-working and good services. <br><br>This resulted in us starting trading in 1983 by importing color chemistry mini lab labs and photographic color paper in 1993 as we became the sole distributor of l.b Russell Photographics Chemistry New Jersey U.S.A later known as Champion Photochemistry, Rochester USA. We were appointed the sole distributor for Pakistan in 1999 and later on, we set up a network of our sub-distributor throughout the country from Karachi, Lahore & Rawalpindi to handle and control our photochemistry business. We have been rated as the highest taxpayer in the National Photo Finishing Market. And we also have a strong and influential penal in our local Chamber Of Commerce and Industry and associated business clubs.<br><br>

									We have been winning awards continuously from 2003 to 2010 for our sales performances including the “best marketing excellence award” and “chemical specialist award 2004, 2006, 2009”. The second phase of our achievements had given us the confidence to come into the field of refurbished photofinishing analog and digital machines firstly we started the import of photofinishing machines from Japan in 2000 and successfully installed more than 800 analog machines. <br><br>We, later on, led the market move to digital printing selling refurbished digital machines - we have installed twenty machines of 12” and five machines of 24” throughout the country and they are running successfully with the full assistance and support of our skilled engineers and skilled staff under the supervision of our efficient admin team.
									<br><br>
									
									With over 400 dealers across the country we have a strong presence in Pakistan and in the global photochemistry market along with a rising presence in other chemical and additive products:</p>
